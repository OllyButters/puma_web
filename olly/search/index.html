But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data.\", 'Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC.', 'Based on this Opal/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach.', 'DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Biomedical Research", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Computational Biology", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Computer Security", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Confidentiality", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Databases, Factual", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Datasets as Topic", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Information Storage and Retrieval", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "United Kingdom", "major": "N"}], "other": ["DataSHIELD", "ELSI", "bioinformatics", "confidentiality", "disclosure", "distributed computing", "intellectual property", "pooled analysis", "privacy"]}, "full_author_list": ["Gaye A", "Marcon Y", "Isaeva J", "LaFlamme P", "Turner A", "Jones E", "Minion J", "Boyd A", "Newby C", "Nuotio M", "Wilson R", "Butters O", "Murtagh B", "Demir I", "Doiron D", "Giepmans L", "Wallace S", "Budin-Lj\u00f8sne I", "Oliver Schmidt C", "Boffetta P", "Boniol M", "Bota M", "Carter K", "deKlerk N", "Dibben C", "Francis R", "Hiekkalinna T", "Hveem K", "Kval\u00f8y K", "Millar S", "Perry I", "Peters A", "Phillips C", "Popham F", "Raab G", "Reischl E", "Sheehan N", "Waldenberger M", "Perola M", "van den Heuvel E", "Macleod J", "Knoppers B", "Stolk R", "Fortier I", "Harris J", "Woffenbuttel B", "Murtagh M", "Ferretti V", "Burton P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Int J Epidemiol", "volume": "43", "issue": "6"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201015655", "PMID": ""}, "title": "The first WASP public data release", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["catalogs", "planets and satellites", "stars", " Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"]}, "full_author_list": ["Butters O", "West R", "Anderson D", "Collier Cameron A", "Clarkson W", "Enoch B", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Horne K", "Joshi Y", "Kane S", "Lister T", "Maxted P", "Parley N", "Pollacco D", "Smalley B", "Street R", "Todd I", "Wheatley P", "Wilson D"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "volume": "520", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1002/lrh2.10461", "PMID": "39444499"}, "title": "Creating a learning health system to include environmental determinants of health: The GroundsWell experience.", "abstract": "['Policies aiming to prevent ill health and reduce health inequalities need to consider the full complexity of health systems, including environmental determinants.

The workshop discussed the risks and benefits of household linkages.

Discussions with NHS England resulted in secure and quality-assured data linkages and a plan to flow these pseudonymised data onwards into regional health boards. Methods were established, including the generation of matching algorithms, transfer processes and information governance approvals. Our collaboration accelerated the development of a new data governance application, facilitating future public health intervention evaluations.', 'These activities have established a secure method for protecting the privacy of NHS patients in England, while allowing linkage of wider environmental data. This enables local health systems to learn from their data and improve health by optimizing non-health factors. Proportionate governance of health and linked non-health data is practical in England for incorporating key environmental factors into a learning health system.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["data privacy", "household record linkage", "public health learning system", "public health research", "record linkage complex systems"]}, "full_author_list": ["Rodgers S", "Geary R", "Villegas-Diaz R", "Buchan I", "Burnett H", "Clemens T", "Crook R", "Duckworth H", "Green M", "King E", "Zhang W", "Butters O"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Learn Health Syst", "volume": "8", "issue": "4"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201116671", "PMID": ""}, "title": "WASP-39b: a highly inflated Saturn-mass planet orbiting a late G-type star", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["WASP-39", "photometric", "radial velocities / planetary systems"]}, "full_author_list": ["Faedi F", "Barros S", "Anderson D", "Brown D", "Collier Cameron A", "Pollacco D", "Boisse I", "H\u00e9brard G", "Lendl M", "Lister T", "Smalley B", "Street R", "Triaud A", "Bento J", "Bouchy F", "Butters O", "Enoch B", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Keenan F", "Miller G", "Moulds V", "Moutou C", "Norton A", "Queloz D", "Santerne A", "Simpson E", "Skillen I", "Smith A", "Udry S", "Watson C", "West R", "Wheatley P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", "volume": "531", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.12688/f1000research.8736.1", "PMID": ""}, "title": "The Biomedical Research Infrastructure Software as a Service Kit (BRISSKit): technical description", "abstract": "With biomedical research becoming ever more computationally intensive, the challenge is to find sophisticated software tools that can keep pace with new requirements, while still being easy to use and secure.

In disciplines like medicine and the social sciences, where collected data include sensitive information about study participants, the sharing and publication of individual-level records is controlled by data protection laws and ethico-legal norms. Thus, as data visualizations - such as graphs and plots - may be linked to other released information and used to identify study participants and their personal attributes, their creation is often prohibited by the terms of data use. These restrictions are enforced to reduce the risk of breaching data subject confidentiality, however they limit analysts from displaying useful descriptive plots for their research features and findings. Here we propose the use of anonymization techniques to generate privacy-preserving visualizations that retain the statistical properties of the underlying data while still adhering to strict data disclosure rules. We demonstrate the use of (i)\\xa0the well-known &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-anonymization process which preserves privacy by reducing the granularity of the data using suppression and generalization, (ii) a novel deterministic approach that replaces individual-level observations with the centroids of each &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; nearest neighbours, and (iii) a probabilistic procedure that perturbs individual attributes with the addition of random stochastic noise. We apply the proposed methods to generate privacy-preserving data visualizations for exploratory data analysis and inferential regression plot diagnostics, and we discuss their strengths and limitations.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["Anonymization", "Data visualizations", "Disclosure control", "Privacy protection", "Sensitive data"]}, "full_author_list": ["Avraam D", "Wilson R", "Butters O", "Burton T", "Nicolaides C", "Jones E", "Boyd A", "Burton P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "EPJ Data Sci", "volume": "10", "issue": "1"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/200911725", "PMID": ""}, "title": "RXTE confirmation of the intermediate polar status   of IGR\u00a0J15094\u20136649", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Butters O", "Norton A", "Mukai K", "Barlow E"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", "volume": "498", "issue": "2"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1088/0004-6256/142/3/86", "PMID": ""}, "title": "WASP-35b, WASP-48b, AND HAT-P-30b/WASP-51b: TWO NEW PLANETS AND AN INDEPENDENT DISCOVERY OF A HAT PLANET", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Enoch B", "Anderson D", "Barros S", "Brown D", "Cameron A", "Faedi F", "Gillon M", "H\u00e9brard G", "Lister T", "Queloz D", "Santerne A", "Smalley B", "Street R", "Triaud A", "West R", "Bouchy F", "Bento J", "Butters O", "Fossati L", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Holmes S", "Jehen E", "Lendl M", "Maxted P", "McCormac J", "Miller G", "Moulds V", "Moutou C", "Norton A", "Parley N", "Pepe F", "Pollacco D", "Segransan D", "Simpson E", "Skillen I", "Smith A", "Udry S", "Wheatley P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "The Astronomical Journal", "volume": "142", "issue": "3"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201116448", "PMID": ""}, "title": "Short period eclipsing binary candidates identified using SuperWASP", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Norton A", "Payne S", "Evans T", "West R", "Wheatley P", "Anderson D", "Barros S", "Butters O", "Collier Cameron A", "Christian D", "Enoch B", "Faedi F", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Holmes S", "Horne K", "Kane S", "Lister T", "Maxted P", "Parley N", "Pollacco D", "Simpson E", "Skillen I", "Smalley B", "Southworth J", "Street R"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", "volume": "528", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.5334/dsj-2017-021", "PMID": ""}, "title": "DataSHIELD \u2013 New Directions and Dimensions", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["data privacy", "sensitive data", " distributed data"]}, "full_author_list": ["Wilson R", "Butters O", "Avraam D", "Baker J", "Tedds J", "Turner A", "Murtagh M", "Burton P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Data Science Journal", "volume": "16", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1186/s12910-017-0167-z", "PMID": "28376776"}, "title": "The ECOUTER methodology for stakeholder engagement in translational research.", "abstract": "[\"Because no single person or group holds knowledge about all aspects of research, mechanisms are needed to support knowledge exchange and engagement. Expertise in the research setting necessarily includes scientific and methodological expertise, but also expertise gained through the experience of participating in research and/or being a recipient of research outcomes (as a patient or member of the public). Engagement is, by its nature, reciprocal and relational: the process of engaging research participants, patients, citizens and others (the many 'publics' of engagement) brings them closer to the research but also brings the research closer to them. When translating research into practice, engaging the public and other stakeholders is explicitly intended to make the outcomes of translation relevant to its constituency of users.\", 'In practice, engagement faces numerous challenges and is often time-consuming, expensive and \\'thorny\\' work. We explore the epistemic and ontological considerations and implications of four common critiques of engagement methodologies that contest: representativeness, communication and articulation, impacts and outcome, and democracy. The ECOUTER (Employing COnceptUal schema for policy and Translation Engagement in Research) methodology addresses problems of representation and epistemic foundationalism using a methodology that asks, \"How could it be otherwise?\" ECOUTER affords the possibility of engagement where spatial and temporal constraints are present, relying on saturation as a method of \\'keeping open\\' the possible considerations that might emerge and including reflexive use of qualitative analytic methods.', \"This paper describes the ECOUTER process, focusing on one worked example and detailing lessons learned from four other pilots.

Urban Green and Blue Spaces (UGBS), and the activities that take place in them, can significantly influence the health outcomes of all communities, and reduce health inequalities. Improving access and quality of UGBS needs understanding of the range of systems (e.g. planning, transport, environment, community) in which UGBS are located. UGBS offers an ideal exemplar for testing systems innovations as it reflects place-based and &lt;i&gt;whole society&lt;/i&gt; processes &lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; with potential to reduce non-communicable disease (NCD) risk and associated social inequalities in health. UGBS can impact multiple behavioural and environmental aetiological pathways. However, the systems which desire, design, develop, and deliver UGBS are fragmented and siloed, with ineffective mechanisms for data generation, knowledge exchange and mobilisation. Further, UGBS need to be co-designed with and by those whose health could benefit most from them, so they are appropriate, accessible, valued and used well. This paper describes a major new prevention research programme and partnership, &lt;i&gt;GroundsWell&lt;/i&gt;, which aims to transform UGBS-related systems by improving how we plan, design, evaluate and manage UGBS so that it benefits all communities, especially those who are in poorest health. We use a broad definition of health to include physical, mental, social wellbeing and quality of life. Our objectives are to transform systems so that UGBS are planned, developed, implemented, maintained and evaluated with our communities and data systems to enhance health and reduce inequalities. GroundsWell will use interdisciplinary, problem-solving approaches to accelerate and optimise community collaborations among citizens, users, implementers, policymakers and researchers to impact research, policy, practice and active citizenship. GroundsWell will be shaped and developed in three pioneer cities (Belfast, Edinburgh, Liverpool) and their regional contexts, with embedded translational mechanisms to ensure that outputs and impact have UK-wide and international application.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": ["Public health; non-communicable disease; green and blue space; complex systems; data science; citizen science; interdisciplinary; health inequalities"]}, "full_author_list": ["Hunter R", "Rodgers S", "Hilton J", "Clarke M", "Garcia L", "Ward Thompson C", "Geary R", "Green M", "O'Neill C", "Longo A", "Lovell R", "Nurse A", "Wheeler B", "Clement S", "Porroche-Escudero A", "Mitchell R", "Barr B", "Barry J", "Bell S", "Bryan D", "Buchan I", "Butters O", "Clemens T", "Clewley N", "Corcoran R", "Elliott L", "Ellis G", "Guell C", "Jurek-Loughrey A", "Kee F", "Maguire A", "Maskell S", "Murtagh B", "Smith G", "Taylor T", "Jepson R"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Wellcome Open Res", "volume": "7", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1093/ije/dyz180", "PMID": "32293006"}, "title": "Automation of cleaning and reconstructing residential address histories to assign environmental exposures in longitudinal studies.", "abstract": "['We have developed an open-source ALgorithm for Generating Address Exposures (ALGAE) that cleans residential address records to construct address histories and assign spatially-determined exposures to cohort participants.

In this opinion paper, we introduce the concept of data curation debt-the data curation equivalent to the software engineering principle of technical debt. Using the context of UK cohort studies, we define data curation debt-describing examples and their potential impact. We highlight that accruing this debt can make it more difficult to use the data in the future. Additionally, the long-running nature of cohort studies means that interest is accrued on this debt and compounded over time-increasing the impact a debt could have on a study and its stakeholders. Primary causes of data curation debt are discussed across three categories: longevity of hardware, software and data formats; funding; and skills shortages. Based on cross-domain best practice, strategies to reduce the debt and preventive measures are proposed-with importance given to the recognition and transparent reporting of data curation debt. Describing the debt in this way, we encapsulate a multi-faceted issue in simple terms understandable by all cohort study stakeholders. Data curation debt is not only confined to the UK, but is an issue the international community must be aware of and address. This paper aims to stimulate a discussion between cohort studies and their stakeholders on how to address the issue of data curation debt. If data curation debt is left unchecked it could become impossible to use highly valued cohort study data, and ultimately represents an existential risk to studies themselves.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Cohort Studies", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Data Curation", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Software", "major": "Y"}], "other": ["Data curation", "cohort studies", "data management"]}, "full_author_list": ["Butters O", "Wilson R", "Burton P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Int J Epidemiol", "volume": "49", "issue": "4"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6", "PMID": "29695297"}, "title": "Better governance, better access: practising responsible data sharing in the METADAC governance infrastructure.", "abstract": "[\"Genomic and biosocial research data about individuals is rapidly proliferating, bringing the potential for novel opportunities for data integration and use. The scale, pace and novelty of these applications raise a number of urgent sociotechnical, ethical and legal questions, including optimal methods of data storage, management and access. Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK's longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research.\", \"This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and 'omic' data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies.\", 'Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency; interdisciplinarity; and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data; the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised.']", "keywords": {"mesh": [{"term": "Big Data", "major": "Y"}, {"term": "Biomedical Research", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Databases, Genetic", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genomics", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Genotype", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Humans", "major": "N"}, {"term": "Information Dissemination", "major": "N"}], "other": ["Data Access Committee (DAC)", "Data access", "Data ethics", "Data governance", "Ethnography", "Governance", "Interdisciplinarity", "Participant involvement", "Qualitative research"]}, "full_author_list": ["Murtagh M", "Blell M", "Butters O", "Cowley L", "Dove E", "Goodman A", "Griggs R", "Hall A", "Hallowell N", "Kumari M", "Mangino M", "Maughan B", "Mills M", "Minion J", "Murphy T", "Prior G", "Suderman M", "Ring S", "Rogers N", "Roberts S", "Van der Straeten C", "Viney W", "Wiltshire D", "Wong A", "Walker N", "Burton P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Hum Genomics", "volume": "12", "issue": "1"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361:20077618", "PMID": ""}, "title": "Discovery of polarized emission from the long period intermediate polar RX J2133.7+5107", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Katajainen S", "Butters O", "Norton A", "Lehto H", "Piirola V"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", "volume": "475", "issue": "3"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1088/0004-637X/724/1/165", "PMID": ""}, "title": "DISCOVERY OF POLARIZED EMISSION FROM TWO SOFT X-RAY-EMITTING INTERMEDIATE POLARS: UU Col AND NY Lup", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Katajainen S", "Butters O", "Norton A", "Lehto H", "Piirola V", "Berdyugin A"], "journal": {"journal_name": "The Astrophysical Journal", "volume": "724", "issue": "1"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1088/0004-6256/141/1/8", "PMID": ""}, "title": "WASP-37b: A 1.8&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;EXOPLANET TRANSITING A METAL-POOR STAR", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Simpson E", "Faedi F", "Barros S", "Brown D", "Cameron A", "Hebb L", "Pollacco D", "Smalley B", "Todd I", "Butters O", "H\u00e9brard G", "McCormac J", "Miller G", "Santerne A", "Street R", "Skillen I", "Triaud A", "Anderson D", "Bento J", "Boisse I", "Bouchy F", "Enoch B", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Holmes S", "Horne K", "Keenan F", "Lister T", "Maxted P", "Moulds V", "Moutou C", "Norton A", "Parley N", "Pepe F", "Queloz D", "Segransan D", "Smith A", "Stempels H", "Udry S", "Watson C", "West R", "Wheatley P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "The Astronomical Journal", "volume": "141", "issue": "1"}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/201015800", "PMID": ""}, "title": "WASP-38b: a transiting exoplanet in an eccentric, 6.87d period orbit", "abstract": "", "keywords": {"mesh": [], "other": []}, "full_author_list": ["Barros S", "Faedi F", "Collier Cameron A", "Lister T", "McCormac J", "Pollacco D", "Simpson E", "Smalley B", "Street R", "Todd I", "Triaud A", "Boisse I", "Bouchy F", "H\u00e9brard G", "Moutou C", "Pepe F", "Queloz D", "Santerne A", "Segransan D", "Udry S", "Bento J", "Butters O", "Enoch B", "Haswell C", "Hellier C", "Keenan F", "Miller G", "Moulds V", "Norton A", "Parley N", "Skillen I", "Watson C", "West R", "Wheatley P"], "journal": {"journal_name": "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics", "volume": "525", "issue": ""}}, {"IDs": {"DOI": "10.12688/f1000research.25484.2", "PMID": "34026049"}, "title": "PUblications Metadata Augmentation (PUMA) pipeline.", "abstract": "[\"Cohort studies collect, generate and distribute data over long periods of time - often over the lifecourse of their participants.

The ability to search and explore these publication lists varies greatly between studies. We believe a lack of rich search and exploration functionality of study publications is a barrier to entry for new or prospective users of a study's data, since it may be difficult to find and evaluate previous work in a given area. These lists of publications are also typically manually curated, resulting in a lack of rich metadata to analyse, making bibliometric analysis difficult. We present here a software pipeline that aggregates metadata from a variety of third-party providers to power a web based search and exploration tool for lists of publications. Alongside core publication metadata (i.e. author lists, keywords etc.), we include geocoding of first authors and citation counts in our pipeline. This allows a characterisation of a study as a whole based on common locations of authors, frequency of keywords, citation profile etc. This enriched publications metadata can be useful for generating study impact metrics and web-based graphics for public dissemination. In addition, the pipeline produces a research data set for bibliometric analysis or social studies of science.
